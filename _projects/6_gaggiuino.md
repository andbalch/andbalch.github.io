excerpt: "This last summer I took the time to perform the <a href='https://gaggiuino.github.io'>Gaggiuino mod</a> on my espresso machine! Basically, this mod allows the machine to be controlled by a microcontroller and do some fancy stuff called "pressure profiling" where it uses pressure, temperature, and weight sensors to pull the perfect shot. It was a lot of fun, but also a lot harder than I thought it would be (mostly because I thought I could swap out some recommended parts). <br/><img src='/images/projects/integration_hell.jpg' width='25%' height='25%'>"
