In my advanced software development course, I led a team of 4 others on a semester-long project building PeerCycle: a platform for UVA students to list belongings the had to get rid of when moving out. My position as Scrum Master (Scrum being the software development paradigm used in the class), made me responsible for coordinating meetings, ensuring features were completed on time, and communicating with project stakeholders. The project is still online [here](https://project-a-30-cs-3240-fefcbb5a7b23.herokuapp.com), but most core functionality has unfortunately been disabled to avoid getting charged. The source code is also available [here](https://github.com/uva-cs3240-f23/project-a-30).
