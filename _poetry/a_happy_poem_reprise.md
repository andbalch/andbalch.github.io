It starts like the sunrise  
My Heart blossoms and unfurls  
Curving and stretching to catch the light  
Filling itself with warmth.

With each gentile rotation  
Of the world between its toes  
My Heart rises and grows  
Roots sneaking further down into the soil  
Swirling and combining in perfect harmony.

If you were to cut open my Heart  
You could read my life by its rings  
Some thick, some thin  
Some dark, some light  
Some scarred, few perfect  
But each building on the other  
Together painting a wholly imperfect picture.

Some day, my Heart will have to move.  
Reintroduced to foreign soil  
Its roots learning to find their hold another time.  
But for now, it enjoys the rising sun,  
And looks forward to each new ring it forms.  

I look down.  
Youâ€™re holding my hand.
