I sit upon my notebook like a hen  
I watch for words to boil from my pen  
But, really,  
I wait for a tap, tap, tap  
On the windowsill

She fell from her nest  
When she was too young to be saved  
But she taught herself to fly  
By watching the leaves in Fall  
And built her home from shiny things  
Thrown out from the windowsill

Maybe she sees me  
As a fallen thing too  
Maybe that’s why she brings me,  
Periodically,  
Scattered shiny things  
And leaves them on my windowsill…
