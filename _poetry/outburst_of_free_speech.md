In response to an unsanctioned outburst of free speech  
We have updated our laws, rules, and guidelines of free speech  

Free speech is permitted everywhere  
That isn't symbolic of this institution

Free speech is accepted anytime  
Between the hours of 9 to 5

Free speech is encouraged in all forms  
Unless you write on buildings,  
set up tents,  
wear masks,  
sit on the ground,  
or talk too loudly

Our utmost priority is ~~our~~ your safety  
All good movements follow authority  

Please be aware that the practical difference  
between laws, rules, and guidelines  
Is that violation of any  
will result in a broken nose  

Free expression and free inquiry are integral to who we are as a community  
So we would like to provide assistance 
on how you may exercise your rights:

You may draw in chalk  
It will be washed

You may write letters  
They will be ignored

You may attend town halls  
They will be scripted

You may pass referendums  
They will not be followed

Above all we are committed to free speech  
But don't you dare  
Do it in a way that bothers the Man on Carrâ€™s Hill.
