The hand reaches down from heaven  
A clenched fist of chrome glints in natural light, eternal  
A finger of flame stretches out to give a gift  
An unwanted kiss atop my head  

Prometheus retreats as soon as he came  
But as his seed I remain  
Standing alone on borrowed time  
The dark hisses and dances on a shadow’s line  

I’ve nothing to do but feel myself shrink  
In a quicksand seat of wax  
Like the dark, it gives way as my heat draws near  
My wick, burning slow, gives it time to retreat  
Stretching my burn ever longer for the unknown patron  

Whether as a twist of fate, a granted wish, or random happenstance  
I find myself burning hotter than I should  
Sinking faster than I should  
Growing closer to the wax than I should  

I’ve nothing to do but feel my life shrink  
Feel my lungs fill  
Feel my flame expire  
Extinguished by my own design  
The last thought I think…  
Was I ever asked to be lit?  
The lighter flicks.
