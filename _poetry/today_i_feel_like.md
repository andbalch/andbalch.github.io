# Today I feel like...

Today I feel like…  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soaring swallow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smacking sheet glass

Today the swallow feels like…  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snacking on a snail  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speeding home to the safe, old stump  

Today the snail feels like…  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shells never snap in two  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattered parts forever separate  

Today the shell feels like…  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting a new career as an egg  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splintered into shiny shards  

Today the swallow’s egg feels like…  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly being swallowed whole  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for mom to come home  

Today I feel like…  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lost egg  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eaten by a fat snake
