Driving along American roads  
For three and a half hours across state lines  
Trying to keep some things off my mind  
With a hair tie ring around my left-hand finger  

What’s left to be said about Americana  
I’ve never really cared much for it  
Churches and gas stations and Confederate flags  
Every one you pass just to see again  

Making conversation with people I don’t know too well  
Feeling as out of place as the power plants I pass  
Every mile we drive a mile to retread  
The rubber band around your neck  
Makes it hard to catch your breath  

Solar farms next to an old gun store  
Progress doesn’t care who it’s for  
I’m just a passenger, waiting to get there  
And feel pulled back again
