excerpt: "<i>Content warning: death</i>"

When my mother’s mother died  
We planted a tree in her stead  
As her mother’s mother did before  

By the time I will die  
My children’s children will plant me  
Under her outstretched boughs  
As their children’s children will for them  

In this forest of my kin there will be  
The richest soil in all the land  
Our descendants will feast  
On each plump peach  
That we carry in our outstretched arms  

They may climb our spines  
To grasp our ancestral arboretum  
They may build their houses  
Upon our collective shoulders  
And sing with the mourning doves  

Until they too  
Will become a bird’s roost  
And bear the fruit of our generations  
And generations  
And generations more  
Will brush our hands against the sky
