title: "Ash and Bone"
excerpt: ""
collection: poetry
---
A ragged sheet of greenish browns  
Covers jagged, ancient crowns

Strewn like shards of broken bone  
Wind and rain make marrow shown  
Wielded by Earth, her skills to hone  
A hammer and chisel to sculpt her own

They settle in the gentle shade  
Of ominous, beautiful spines long made  
Acres of homes and crops outlaid  
Land fertilized by a giant slayed

Passages cut with bone saw and scalpel  
To connect each toe and nostril  
Towers rise to frame each fracture  
The sheet is burned and ash is reaped  
From which something new will forever emerge.
