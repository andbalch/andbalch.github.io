Your dark sky hides  
Your stars and your asteroids  
From my prying eyes

Your dark sky hides  
Your moon from my soul  
But not your seas from its pull

Your dark sky hides  
My colonial flags and  
The satellites of my warring nations

Your dark sky hides  
Your wound I dare not heal  
So that I may break through anew.

My life on your earth  
I will not protect.  
Your children of green  
I will break and burn.  
Your fields of gold  
I will plow into ash.  
Your waters of blue  
Will quench my silicon  
But never my thirst.  

I will step on my kin  
One by one  
Until I reach  
Your dark sky,  
Pull it down,  
And feast  
On your stars and your asteroids.
