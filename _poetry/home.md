I’ve begun to notice how things fill a room  
Like different dyes poured into a stream  
Swirling and mixing, eventually fading  
Replaced by the ubiquitous current

How is it that a space full of people and light  
Can feel empty yet suffocating?  
How is it that a salmon can return to its spawn  
And still be lost though it’s been found?

A play you’ve seen your whole life  
Has a new facade  
Nothing else has changed and yet  
You see the whole thing in a new light

Glancing at the empty seat to your right  
Makes your gaping heart ache more  
Trying to find another to fill it  
Just makes it all worse when you come and sit down again

It’s said that “Home is where the heart is”  
But where is home when the heart is lost?
