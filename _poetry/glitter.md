I’m watching you as I write  
Your pen in your mouth  
Your legs perpendicular to mine  
That look you have when you’re focused  
The one I love being the object of  
The one where I feel you swimming in my eyes

You shift and adjust  
I stare as I must  
Helpless as your hand brushes my leg  
Hopeless to the feeling that erupts

Beautiful clouds swirling  
A thousand specks winking  
Swirling down and settling  
To kiss the surface of my skin.

A beauty that can only be felt:  
The way you make me melt  
To the tips of your fingers, I knelt  
Presenting my aching body and heart.

You sense my body tense  
You tilt your head and smile  
Your eyes iridescent in my light  
Irises like suns in a green-gray sky  
In them, a wink of cheeky knowing  

The glitter of love you make me feel  
Could make a billion butterflies soar,  
It makes me write.
