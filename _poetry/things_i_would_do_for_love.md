I wince at being this dramatic,  
But I would get stabbed for Love.  

Somewhere in the thigh, enough to know it’s there  
The perpetrator: a blurry-faced enigma  
I would bandage myself up and limp to my reward  

That’s not how Love works.  

Oh I hate to be this graphic,  
But I would get hit by a car for Love.  

Alone on the street, nowhere really to be  
The driver speeds away, windows too tinted to make out a face  
In the ambulance, I’d ask the universe who it is

That’s not how Love works.

Why would it be this drastic,  
But I would go insane for Love.

Let myself go, free to feel what I feel inside  
I’d be hugged by a straightjacket, fastened by a nameless nurse  
When I’m given my first meal, I’d starve until my visitor arrived

That’s not how Love works.

Perhaps the only thing you can do for Love  
is to wait for it to find you.
