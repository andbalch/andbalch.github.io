Most of what I write  
Is scattered stanzas of Sadness  
All of what I write  
I write to let emotion wash over me  

A friend said  
Just a few hours ago  
“I like this one,  
But can you show me a Happy poem?”  

I know the forms pain takes  
A wave, a scar, a bird  
I know how to hold it in a metaphor  
And tie it up with rhyme  

But when it comes to Happiness  
It’s not something I know best  

I’ve seen it written  
As a ray of sun, a skipping heart  
Amalgamations of excitement and light  
I don’t find many memories that match  

Maybe it’s because, unlike Sadness  
I don’t stop to listen when it crashes  
Or feel the need to write it’s edges  
And wax poetic about it’s plumage  

Maybe it’s because, unlike Sadness  
I aspire to it  
Some write Happiness as a rainbow  
While I may write it as a pot of gold  

Maybe it’s because, like Sadness  
Happiness takes many forms  
It’s a sleeping fawn in a golden glade  
While its a fire-lit room of laughter  

Something I’ve noticed  
In writing these lines:  
Happiness and Sadness rhyme  
More than they contradict  

“I don’t think I have many of those”
