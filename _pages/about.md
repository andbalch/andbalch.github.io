**I am excited to share that I recently recieved an honorable mention for the NSF GRFP!**

Hi! I'm a PhD student at the University of Michigan School of Information. I have a special interest in applying computer science, machine learning, and data science to inform and aid in social issues, including critical analyses of how information technology impacts society and perpetuates injustice. This has been motivated by my coursework in sociology, which inspired me to write [a paper on the power structures that enable algorithmic injustice](https://www.andrewbalch.com/paper/2024-05-20-why-algorithms-remain-unjust).

Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher at the UVA School of Engineering and Applied Science's [Human-AI Technology Lab](https://hai-lab-uva.github.io) for three years, working alongside PhD students. I led a project leveraging ubiquitous devices to gain accessible, noninvasive insights into micronutrient status. We recently submitted a [review paper](https://www.andrewbalch.com/paper/2025-05-18-accessible-micronutrient-assessment) on the subject and I demo'd a prototype, smartphone-based device for Vitamin B12 quantification at the 2024 ACM Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking where I won 3rd place in the Student Research Competition!

Other work I've done at the HAI Lab includes topics such as [cancer treatment modeling](https://www.andrewbalch.com/paper/2024-05-10-capstone-technical-report) and constrained reinforcement learning. The breadth of my work has taught me both hard and soft skills, and my interest in sociology drives an interdisciplinary and critical approach to these problems. My research has been supported by two Dean’s Undergraduate Research Fellowships, was acknowledged by the Computer Science department’s Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award for 2022-2023, and was an Honorable Mention for the same award for 2023-2024. In Fall 2024, I was named as a finalist for the Computing Research Association's [2024-25 Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award](https://cra.org/crae/awards/cra-outstanding-undergraduate-researchers/)!

Outside of school and research, I'm an avid rock climber (bouldering and sport), coffee nerd, and tinkerer. I also enjoy poetry as a form of self-expression. You can read a few of my poems [here](https://www.andrewbalch.com/poetry)!
