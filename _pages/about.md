Hi! I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science. I have a special interest in applying computer science, machine learning, and data science to inform and aid in social issues, including critical analyses of how information technology impacts society and perpetuates injustice. This has been motivated by my coursework in sociology, which inspired me to write [a paper on the power structures that enable algorithmic injustice](https://www.andrewbalch.com/paper/2024-05-20-why-algorithms-remain-unjust).

I've been an undergraduate researcher at the [UVA Human-AI Technology Lab](https://hai-lab-uva.github.io) since my first year in college, working alongside PhD students. I lead a project leveraging ubiquitous devices to gain accessible, noninvasive insights into micronutrient status. We recently submitted a review paper on the subject (which you can check out [here](https://www.andrewbalch.com/paper/2024-08-21-accessible-micronutrient-assessment)) and I presented my poster on a prototype, smartphone-based device for Vitamin B12 quantification at the 2024 Commonwealth Cyber Initiative Symposium (available [here](https://www.andrewbalch.com/projects/2_smartphone_spectro)).

Other work I've done at the HAI Lab includes topics such as [cancer treatment modeling](https://www.andrewbalch.com/paper/2024-05-10-capstone-technical-report) and constrained reinforcement learning. The breadth of my work has taught me both hard and soft skills, and my interest in sociology drives an interdisciplinary and critical approach to these problems. My research has been supported by two Dean’s Undergraduate Research Fellowships, was acknowledged by the Computer Science department’s Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award for 2022-2023, and was an Honorable Mention for the same award for 2023-2024. Recently, I was 1 of 4 students to be nominated by UVA Computer Science for the Computing Research Association's Oustanding Undergraduate Researcher award, and was recently featured in [an article by UVA Today](https://news.virginia.edu/content/peek-summer-research-engineering-deans-fellows)!

Outside of school and research, I'm an avid rock climber (bouldering and sport), coffee nerd, and tinkerer. I also enjoy poetry as a form of self-expression. You can read a few of my poems [here](https://www.andrewbalch.com/poetry)!
