excerpt: 'I was granted another opportunity to present my work on smartphone-based spectrophotometry for micronutrient assessment at ACM BCB 2024! Although I didn’t get to go (the dates overlapped with <a href="https://www.andrewbalch.com/paper/2024-11-19-spectrophotometer-demo">my MobiCom demo</a>), it is still an honor to have my work represented.

I was granted another opportunity to present my work on smartphone-based spectrophotometry for micronutrient assessment at ACM BCB 2024! Although I didn't get to go (the dates overlapped with [my MobiCom demo](https://www.andrewbalch.com/paper/2024-11-19-spectrophotometer-demo)), it is still an honor to have my work represented.
