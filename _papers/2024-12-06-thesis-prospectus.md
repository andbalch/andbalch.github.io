excerpt: "In Fall 2024, I completed my thesis prospectus for my B.S. in Computer Science. The prospectus outlines the technical and STS contributions of my thesis. I use Actor-Network Theory to connect these two aspects in the context of social justice, emphasizing how algorithmic systems shape and are shaped by society. Next Spring, I will be conducting an STS research project on algorithmic influence in mobile applications to round-out my thesis. More details about the technical component are described in <a href='https://www.andrewbalch.com/paper/2024-05-10-capstone-technical-report'>my capstone research paper</a>."

## Excerpt Introducing the STS Perspective

In building a technological system that guides and informs human decisions, I must
recognize that I am engaged in an action that is fundamentally political (Green, 2021). My tool
encodes normative understandings of the world and applies them to individuals (patients and
clinicians). This is an example of how algorithmic systems are actors, which shape and are
shaped by social processes (Joyce et al., 2021). An interplay between society and algorithmic
systems is evidenced by the social harms, biases, and injustices that are perpetuated by these
systems (Burrell & Fourcade, 2021; Eubanks, 2018). Many approaches to addressing these issues
have been proposed, with the most promising being algorithmic justice initiatives which seek to
understand and ameliorate oppression in its varied yet intersecting forms (Chordia et al., 2024;
Dombrowski et al., 2016). Theories, debates, and analyses within algorithmic justice often focus
most on high-risk, high-profile cases (e.g. recidivism prediction). In the second half of this
prospectus, I will apply actor-network theory (ANT) (Latour & others, 1992) to analyze the role
of algorithms as social mediators, and argue for a deeper understanding of how algorithms
influence our day-to-day lived experience, and how they may do so (un)justly.
