excerpt: 'In November 2024, I had the opportunity to demo how a smartphone-based spectrophotometer can be used to quantify micronutrients (vitamin B12) to conference attendees at MobiCom 2024 in Washington D.C.! This was a great exercise of my public speaking and presentation skills, and I got to meet lots of other researchers and learn about their work.
