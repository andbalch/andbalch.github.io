This report was the final deliverable for the semester-long group research project in my graduate-level Human-Computer Interaction class. Motivated by an understanding that privacy and security needs are informed by individual backgrounds, we sought to understand how these unique needs manifest in the context of mobile application permissions to hopefully guide inclusive app designs. We designed, distributed, analyzed, and presented the results of a study aimed at forming an understanding of how users' gender, race and ethnicity, and nationality impact the permissions they allow to a mobile app, and to what degree they allowed these permissions. In addition, we explored how app genres interact with these demographic factors to affect permission-granting.

## Abstract

Privacy and security are crucial functions in most user applications,
especially smartphone apps. An individual’s privacy needs, concerns, and preferences can vary based on demographic factors as
well as the type of application. Precise understanding of how age,
race, ethnicity, nationality, and app genre plays a role in allowing
those permissions is important for inclusive and diversity-oriented
application and system designs. In this study, we conducted a survey
to understand how demographic factors and app genre affect the
data permissions users grant to an app. Our survey design includes
a series of hypothetical scenarios involving different mobile app
genres, where participants were instructed to indicate the permissions they would allow, to what degree they would allow them, and
how they expected the app to use this information. We conducted
a preliminary study to identify the most effective scenario description approach, which we later employed in our main survey design.
Our main survey collected users’ demographic information, privacy and security preferences across different app genres, and their
expectation on the collected app data usage. The demographics of
our sample was diverse, with a total number of 81 participants in
our study. We found race and ethnicity had significant effects on
permission-granting, while age, gender and nationality did not. We
also found that app genres had a pivotal role in privacy decisions of
participants. Last, we discovered an interaction between nationality
and app genre for permissions granted to an app. The findings of
our study hold implications for more inclusive and privacy-focused
mobile application designs.
