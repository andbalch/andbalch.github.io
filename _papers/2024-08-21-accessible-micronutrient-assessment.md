## Abstract

Nutrients are critical to the functioning of the human body and their imbalance can result in detrimental
health concerns. The majority of nutritional literature focuses on macronutrients, often ignoring the
more critical nuances of micronutrient balance, which require more precise regulation. Currently,
micronutrient status is routinely assessed via complex methods that are arduous for both the patient and
the clinician. To address the global burden of micronutrient malnutrition, innovations in assessment
must be accessible and noninvasive. In support of this task, this article synthesizes useful background
information on micronutrients themselves, reviews the state of biofluid and physiological analyses for
their assessment, and presents actionable opportunities to push the field forward. By taking a unique,
clinical perspective that is absent from technological research on the topic, we find that the state of
the art suffers from limited clinical relevance, a lack of overlap between biofluid and physiological
approaches, and highly invasive and inaccessible solutions. Future work has the opportunity to
maximize the impact of a novel assessment method by incorporating clinical relevance, the holistic
nature of micronutrition, and prioritizing accessible and noninvasive systems.
